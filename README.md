# Navigation-Algorithm-for-Autonomous-Robotic-Car-System
The aim of this project is to build a robotic system that can autonomously traverse a known area and detect the images in the the arena. The algorithm aims to find the most efficient path for getting to the images, and at the same time avoid the obstacles.
